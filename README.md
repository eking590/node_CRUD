# node_CRUD
this node_api is a CRUD app for users details: which are name, email, status, and id 
here i installed the following 
- npm run dev ; for automatic running of the server in development 
- npm i express => to create our api routes 
- npm  i moment => to insert date and time to our api 
- npm i uuid => to create our Id since we are not using a database 

postman was used to test our api routes if they are working properly
